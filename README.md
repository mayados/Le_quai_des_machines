# Le Quai Des Machines
Context : We had to create a website for a fictive restaurant based in Nantes (France), inspired by "Les Machines de l'Ile" of Nantes. We had also to respect a graphic chart.

This web site is made in HTML/CSS/JS and PHP.

## Description

The main goals were working :
- in a team with Git/Github
- on the front end in order to put into practice the basics learned during the training.
