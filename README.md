# Le Quai Des Machines
Context : We had to create a website for a fictive restaurant based in Nantes (France), inspired by "Les Machines de l'Ile" of Nantes. We had also to respect a graphic chart.

This web site is made in HTML/CSS/JS and PHP.

## Description

The main goals were working :
- in a team with Git/Github
- on the front end in order to put into practice the basics learned during the training. 
- using JavaScript
- concerning the PHP part, we wanted to practice with the superglobals like GET, POST and SESSION as well as the manipulation of tables.
This is why you will not find a DataBase and SQL requests.

- a navigation bar (with different sections, the logo,the dark mode button)
- a gallery section
- section menu with the differents dishes of the week and a video
- section events of the restaurant
- contact/booking form
- footer with the open hours
- the ability to delete a reservation and to change the number of customers

- Display an accordion menu 
- Downloading the menu in PDF format and open it in a new tab
